# Tidytuesday

My contributions to the [Tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data visualization challenge.

> A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the `R4DS Online Learning Community` and the `R for Data Science` textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem. However, any code-based methodology is welcome - just please remember to share the code used to generate the results.
